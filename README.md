# Tinder Preview

A simple iOS tweak that adds some convenience to the matches list in Tinder. Made for research purposes, and for fun, with the help of Cycript. 

Tested with Tinder **7.2.2**. 

*(Group matches are currently not supported)*

## Long press match cell for options
Shows a custom made action sheet with the following options:

* Show profile
* Message
* Report
* Unmatch

## Show a user's profile from the matches list

Tap a profile picture on a match cell to show the user's profile. 

Only supported under the **Messages** section, for obvious reasons ;)
